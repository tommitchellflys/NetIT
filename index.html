            <h2>Nathaniel </h2>

            <p>I have spent nearly 15 years in the hospitality industry. with a strong background in gaming. 
               I have been a duty manager in a few clubs around Canberra. While working in clubs I also owned 
               and operated a small cleaning business for 6 years. I specialised in domestic cleaning but also 
               had a few commercial contracts. During January of 2020 I decided to resign from my full-time role 
               as Duty Manager so I could focus on building the cleaning business so I could sell it. 2 weeks after 
               I resigned from the club I managed to become fully booked and started working 6 days per week, 2 weeks 
               later we were hit with the pandemic, resulting in the sudden loss of 90% of my customer base. After trying
                to keep the business afloat for two months, I made the hardest decision of my life, which was to close the 
                cleaning business indefinitely. After the business closed, I decided to try and up skill by enrolling into a 
                Bachelor of Management. I have completed three units at a university level with a high credit average to date.

            <p>My name is Angeles. I was born in Chile, moved to Switzerland when I was 10 and later to Australia when I was 16. 
			I speak English, Spanish, and French fluently. While I was living in Switzerland, I tried to go for my 4th language and moving to the German-speaking side of the country on my own. 
			I did not realise the many different dialects that the German language has, and I ended up learning a specific type of Swiss-German. 
			I have always had a passion for art and technology, and I did a graphic design diploma when I finished high school. I thought it would allow me to have both combined. 
			I have had the chance to work in the industry for 2 years now. I decided to study IT because I knew that I wanted to upgrade my skill set. After some time, I concluded that UX design was a great path to follow for me.

            <h2>Rabeed</h2>

            <p>I was born in Bangladesh and moved to Australia when I was 8 years old. 
               At the time I primarily spoke Bengali but was rather fluent in English too 
               as I had grown up playing games and watching films that were in English. 
               It was a also a requirement at the school I attended to speak English at all 
               times as well so that we could learn the language easier so that definitely helped 
               with the transition as well. I still speak Bengali with family as well as English. 
               So far to date I have completed my high school studies here, graduating from Macquarie
                Fields High School after transferring, and currently undergoing my tertiary studies. 
                Aside, from that I really enjoy gaming during my spare time, a good single player 
                game can take up hours of my time on a good day. I also love cars as well, 
                and the feeling of driving, something that I can’t quite put into words.

                              this role is responsible for advising government agencies on how to better equip their services 
                              to ensure that they are meeting high quality cyber standards by creating and implementing new 
                              infrastructure and platforms. Preforming penetration testing is the main reason I decided to 
                              pursue a degree in IT, I find ethical hacking to be extremely interesting.

                           <p>Software Developer:<br>
                              The developer is expected to work with other developers 
                              and analysts as a team. Secure APIs will also be developed to access the payment system, 
                              and message queues will be used to process the high amount of real time payments that will take place. 
                              This position will be challenging as real time payment processing requires fast response time and a 
                              high expectation of uninterrupted service, in order to ensure smooth financial transactions. 
                              Any service breakdowns will cause huge financial loss to the client and significantly reduce 
                              customer satisfaction. The developer is expected to be a team player who works with 
                              other IT professionals in the company.

                                UI designers also need a working understanding of coding and transfer the brand’s strength through

                              is a start-up. I have always liked the culture of start-ups from hearing anecdotes of friends 
                              and colleagues that have worked at start-ups and it always seems up beat and a great place to 
                              learn new skills as you are closer to the development cycle of the products I feel. I have also

			      <h4>Crypto Currency</h4>
			      <p>Blockchain and Crypto currency
                  Crypto currency in its rawest form is a digital asset based on a network that is distributed and controlled via a network of computers. The structure if this network is decentralised which allows crypto currencies to exist outside the control of governments and central authorities such as banks.<br>
                  
                  Blockchain 
                  As its name suggests a blockchain is essentially a set of connected blocks on an online ledger. A block is made up of transactions that have been independently verified by each member of the network. Every new block generated must be verified by each node making it essentially impossible to for transaction histories. The contents of the online ledger must be agreed upon by the entire network of an individual node, which provides an unmatched level of security.
                  
                  Blockchain technology can be utilised by many industries for a variety of uses, some examples of this are supply chain technologies, online voting, crowd funding, and banking applications just to name a few.<br>
                  
                  Some types of crypto currencies include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Xrp, Ripple, Solana, Enjin, Mana and many more, each crypto currency provides solutions / function. For example, Mana (Decentraland) is a coin that facilitates purchases of all types in its metaverse, Xrp is used to facilitate transfers by banks between different geographies.
                  
                  Satoshi nakamoto created Bitcoin, it went “online” in 2009. BTC remains the most widely traded and covered cryptocurrency to date. As of November 2021, there were 18.8 million bitcoins in circulation with a total market cap of around 1.2trillion dollars. There is a cap of 21 million bitcoins to ever exist meaning the value will continue to increase.
                  
                  Due to bitcoins amazing success and the obvious solutions blockchains offer, many other cryptocurrencies have been launched, known as alt-coins (some listed above ). Some of these are clones or “forks” of bitcoin while others were built from scratch. By November 2021 the aggregate value of all crypto currencies had reached 2.1trillion – BTC  represented approx. 41% of that total value.
                  
                  Fiat currencies are a crypto currency that has its value pegged to that of a standard currency E.g USD , pound etc<br>
                  
                  As of December 2021, El Salvador is the only country in the world to allow bitcoin as legal tender for money for monetary transaction.  Jurisdiction in regard to crypto varies the world over.  
                  
                  Cryptocurrencies are distributed / sold on a variety of exchanges like that of a stock exchange. Some examples of crypto exchanges are binance, kucoin, crypto.com and a variety of brokers the world over. Crypto currencies are also often sold via the company’s website, especially before they are approved for exchanges such as binance etc.<br>
                  
                  Cryptocurrencies are generated by mining. Mining is a process that involves downloading software that contains a partial or full history of the blockchain and confirming future transactions which is rewarded in a small payout of the cryptocurrency you’re mining.
                  
                  Crypto currencies are an alternative to our current monetary system.  The goal is to streamline existing financial architecture to make it more efficient, while taking the control away from institutions such as banks and returning it to the masses.
                  
                  Blockchains and the crypto currencies operating throughout them have the potential to transform well established financial institutions and bring lower costs, faster execution of transactions, improved transparency meaning total reform to our financial sector. 
                  
                  Blockchain will reduce the massive duplication of information that creates delays, conflicts and confusion in many aspects of financial services, for example, when a syndicate of lenders participates in a loan, having one shared ledger means they don’t all need to be tracking the ledger independently. International’s payments and corporate stock records
                  Are examples of financial areas with huge inefficiencies because of record duplication.
                  
                  It is entirely possible that in years to come we will see private businesses implementing their own private blockchains to improve the transparency and traceability of their financial operations, supply chains, inventory management systems and other internal business systems. 
                  
                  Blockchain is destined to create profound changes in almost all industries, for example blockchains will instantiate massive changes to health care, doctors’ clinicians and facilities will have better access to health records without location being a barrier. The transportation industry will see changes to the platform sued to track time, date and condition removes delivery charges for things like delays and damaged products. Retail and manufacturing companies can expect to see changes to the way they respond to consumer demand and could track provenance products. Once implemented blockchain will provide the ability for clear proof of origin for the oil and gas industry, eliminating all black-market concerns among other dubious sources and concerns. Possibly most excitingly blockchain has the ability to remove a lot of the anonymity surrounding governments making the day-to-day actions of our politicians more transparent.
                  
                  As blockchain becomes more and more of a staple for our modern world, your average human is more and more likely to be interacting with blockchain style technologies on a day-to-day basis. As we have covered above blockchain is destined to cause massive e reform to almost all areas of our lives providing less anonymity to the “powers at be” and less of a veil for them to hide behind. The good news is you wont necessarily notice a difference in how you perform most functions that are destined to be reformed in the future. For example, validating a contract in the future will work a lot the same way, however the way that information is stored will be reformed with the use of blockchain technology making it safer and more transparent for everyone involved. 
                  All in all I think its extremely likely that blockchain will be affecting almost every part of your life in one way or another in the not so distant future.

			      <h4>Cyber Security</h4>
			      <p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting critical systems by adding multiple layers of protection spread across computers, applications, data that one or an organization wish to keep confidential. The technology in its current state is viable, however the majority public are not educated enough to implement these measures in our day to day lives. ASCS report produced by the Australian Cyber Security Centre reports cybercrime increased 13% over the 2020-21 financial year and the cost of cybersecurity and losses involved have also increased. Most organizations, as well as smaller business, has however, made cybersecurity a priority over 2021. The pandemic is the primary cause of this response as most organizations and business had to employ digital strategies in order to continue operating. This has ranged from setting up employees among various organizations with their own devices which came with all the latest VPN services and protections in line with cybersecurity to ensure no data would be leaked from these devices while they were out of the organizations reach. As well as businesses enrolling online websites for their products and ensuring there to be a up to date privacy policy making their customers aware of what data was being collected as well as ensuring that the securities in place among the website and the POS systems are secure enough to not have their data leaked. 

It is best to continue the education and provide more resources and avenues to help implement cybersecurity among organizations, businesses and the general public to avoid further increasing losses of monetary amounts as well as sensitive data. The ASCS have already taken this step in publishing various alerts and advisories on the cyber.gov.au website which in itself had seen over 7.8 million traction and they continue to publish step by step guides to assist older Australians and smaller businesses, and they also provide exercises to organizations to strengthen their cyber resilience. This should be the primary goal over the next few years as the world is thrust into a more digital age, as society I believe is not aware of the private data that may have already been or can potentially be leaked and unfortunately by the time we do become aware, it is too late. People need to be more educated in the different privacy policies that are enrolled among different organizations and businesses. And even more important for these organizations to ensure that they don’t lose their customers’ data due to negligent cybersecurity measures. 

AI and Machine learning have played parts in the advancement of cybersecurity. Such as Deep Learning being used to track logs, transactions and real-time data to find a threat within a network, by learning to spot patterns and signaling the potential attempt of an attack. This also falls in line with behavioral analytics which is stored and then reviewed for any patterns or habits among the users of the network. A baseline is set through organizations and any abnormal increase to data transmissions allows to identify a possible threat to the network. Blockchain is another advancement aiding cybersecurity. Blockchain itself is presented as a decentralized system with no central server. It allows each participant to have an updated copy of a large register, thus making it transparent, and traceability is easier as the logs can be checked by any member. Furthermore, hardware authentication has also made it harder for breaches as technology generates a unique code which then requires used input as well as the initial password in order to access the data. This is often referred to as 2 factor authentication and has been widely adopted to increase security among user accounts.  

 

Educating society on cybersecurity in this digital could potentially reduce the losses involved in data breaches and leaks. It can ensure that large organizations and businesses and the general public don’t lose monetary value or even go as far as sensitive personal data stolen. The more resources available to educate on the current technologies available in terms of cybersecurity can potentially allow society to be more open to new innovations as they will feel safe knowing there are parameters in place to protect themselves in case something does happen to fail. These measures being taken early can save organizations and people alike time and the sensitive data they store. This applies to all new innovations as mentioned such as AI and Machine Learning as well as Blockchain as secure as that may be. Without these measure, these technologies unfortunately will become redundant and possibly never used as society feels it to be unsafe to their sensitive data.  

As such, further education is required for everyone in order to effectively implement these new innovations. Blockchain is still rather new but has picked up traction, primarily with NFTs which in itself also has cybersecurity measures in place in order to avoid duplication of copyrighted items. Furthermore, AI and Machine Learning is already an area of skepticism. Primarily since people are not very confident with a technology potentially having the ability to think and learn on its own, even if it is employed to simply pick patterns within a network to identify threats. This is once again, due to lack of knowledge in the technology. With further education and implementation of these new technologies, it can also branch off to creating more job opportunities as there would be more people qualified to service these new technologies as they come, as well as new study options for both domestic and international students within various countries.   



As someone who likes learning about new innovations, I believe these new technologies will have a positive impact in my life. With the advancements in cybersecurity, I can have peace in mind no matter where I am within the digital space. It will allow me to keep my work and personal items separate as they will be on different networks each with its own security protocols in place. It will allow me to create more digital spaces with my family where we all may be able to interact with each other, knowing that any information shared within that space stays within said family. AI and Machine Learning is a particularly interesting area to see how broad that technology can be in terms implementation given that this technology can be implemented to learn on its own to detect threats better. Blockchain, I will be honest is an area I lack knowledge in but that reinforces my point in the importance of education for these new technologies even more so that people understand what they are using. Transparency is key, as I am sure myself and many others – my family and friends among them – would hate to be in the scenario where data you did not know was being collected in terms of “protection” only for it to be leaked as a result of a breach due to one of these new technologies failing, thus creating distrust. I personally have had experiences with family members who would refrain from receiving information through digital means as they were under the impression that it would not be secure and that sensitive documents that would be sent digitally could be accessed by phishers and potential data breachers. Hence a direct example of fear due to lack of knowledge with the technology.</p>

			      <h4>Cloud Services</h4>
			      <p>
                  Cloud Services
“Cloud Services” refers to a wide range of services delivered on demand to companies and customers over the internet. these applications are designed to deliver services to the user in an and affordable way, while removing the need for internal infrastructure or additions hardware. Whether its checking email or collaborating most people are using cloud services in one way or another even if they aren’t aware of it. Cloud services are provided by vendors and service providers, they are made available to customers from the service providers servers, meaning there is no need for a company to assume the overheads of hosting its own applications or services etc on its own on premises servers.

Public cloud services are services that a provider makes available to numerous customers over the web. The SAAS – Software as a service, IAAS – Infrastructure as a service and PAAS – Platform as a service are all examples of public cloud services. The ability to share resources is at scale is one of the biggest benefits to public cloud services. This allows organisations to offer more capabilities with less over heads then conventional methods.

Private Cloud services are services that a provider does not make generally available to corporate users or subscribers. Apps and data are made available through the organizations own internal infrastructure with a private cloud services model. The platform and software serve one company exclusively and are not made available to external users. The private cloud model is utilised by companies that work with highly sensitive data such as those in healthcare or banking industries, which allows them to leverage advanced security protocols and extend resources in a virtualised environment.

There is an arrangement where both private and public cloud services can be combined to form a Hybrid cloud environment. This arrangement is mostly utilised when the user / organisation needs to store sensitive data in a private cloud, but also requires employees to access apps and resources in a public cloud for day-to-day communication and collaboration.

SAAS
Software as a service, A very broad category which includes a wide variety of services. File storage and backup, web-based email, project management tools are all part of the SAAS line-ups examples are Dropbox, Gsuite,Microsoft Office 365, slack etc. in each of these applications users can access, share, store and “secure” information in the cloud.

IAAS
Infrastructure as a service. IAAS provides the infrastructure that many cloud service providers need to manage SAAS tools. IAAS supplies the complete datacentre framework, removing the need for on-site installations. Examples of IAAS are AWS, Microsoft Azure etc. these providers maintain all storage servers and networking hardware, also offer load balancing, application firewalls and many more features depending on the service chosen. Many well-known SAAS providers are run and maintained on IAAS platforms.

PAAS
Platform as a service. PAAS provides a web based environment where developers can build cloud apps. PAAS provides a database, operating system and programming language that organisations can use to develop cloud based software, without maintain the underlying elements.

Cloud services are often provided on a monthly or annual basis which removes the requirement for software licencing for on premise machines, removing the need to invest in onsite infrastructure and equipment. Also greatly increasing flexibility as services are implemented in an on demand, as-needed basis meaning the business can cancel the subscription or shut down the service with little no outlay and minimum cost to the customer.

Cloud computing has had a profound effect on the world, as a direct result of cloud computing / cloud services remote work has become not only a possibility but coupled with the pandemic a total reality for a lot of people the world over, without cloud services this would be a lot less possible. Another key area cloud computing has greatly affected is cost reduction, because resources can be so widely spread the ability to spread cost means greatly reduced cost for everyone involved, and as a direct result high end programs / services are more widely accessible.

Another key benefit to cloud computing and how it has transformed the way we use tech is its scalability. scalability is the key benefit to cloud technology as the client has the flexibility to scale up and scale down the resources as per its requirements.

Cloud computing’s flexibility has seen it once again mould the text industry, slowly transforming it into the futuristic tech industry we are currently in, thanks to the flexibility cloud computing offers the average customer or user is free to decide which services they want to use and pay for. 

 Cloud services are being used to support social impacts, even involved in reducing carbon emissions. The impact of cloud computing in our day to day lives varies but is very prevalent, some examples of how cloud computing affects us. Social media, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, twitter etc all use the cloud in one way or another IE the pictures we upload are all stored in the cloud. Entertainment  industry has been completetly overhauled with cloud computing , where we would before go and rent a dvd, buy our music in cd format etc etc  now we directly stream our entertainment. Netflix , amazon, spotify, etc all utilise  the cloud. Even the way we shop has been revolutionised by the cloud with ecommerce companies like Amazon , Flipkart etc also employing the cloud. Doctors offices establish cloud based portals where important health data is accessible. Universites offer courses online via learning materials, stored in the cloud. 

In conclusion the impact of cloud computing is almost everywhere, it’s a  remarkable revolution that continues to shape our world.

			      <h4>Machine Learning</h4>
			      <p>Machine learning is the training of computer programs such as algorithms, using collections of data called datasets, to 1) construct a model for a problem and 2) make decisions about the problem, often without further human intervention. 

A state-of-the-art example is a probabilistic model for recommendations called SVD++, which is a new algorithm to recommend products to customers, called a recommender.
A recommender is a beneficial aid for customers to shop because it will increase the likelihood that people find the product they want, which leads to them buying and thereby increasing revenue. This is most often used in e-commerce and streaming services settings. 

The field of machine learning has vast and important applications in many industries, especially in fast decision making in financial, banking and insurance. The technology is a marked improvement from earlier programs written based on business rules and logics; since the algorithm learns from datasets to derive its own rules, it evolves with the dataset over time. The following are some current applications:

Machine Learning is extensively used in banks for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions, by preventing suspicious transactions outside of the customer’s daily spending patterns from going through. 

Credit Scoring
Machine Learning algorithms are employed in loan assessments, evaluating risks of loan applicants based on their profiles to produce a credit score, in order to reduce future loan defaults. The financial institution can also choose to be lenient with non-performing loans, by helping customers with good credit scores to restructure their loan obligations instead of taking more drastic measures such as foreclosures.

Email Spam Filtering
Spam messages are causing unnecessary clogging of email inboxes. The purpose of spam filtering is to improve user experience by filtering out spam messages into a different folder. Many intelligent spam filtering systems are now using machine learning algorithms to detect spam messages based on learning the patterns and style of past spam messages, instead of simple phrase or word matching used in the past. 

Transport Planning
Machine Learning can be used to plan out a traffic network, by learning data from traffic patterns from different days and times of the day. The datasets of vehicles and people movement are learned by the algorithms to produce a model that establishes existing patterns, so that it can be used by the planner to reduce wastage of service capacity in areas not likely to generate traffic.


One important future application of machine learning is training algorithms in full self-driving vehicles. The algorithm will be trained with 1) on-road datasets collected by various sensors such as fast developing radar technologies to determine immediate response to different road situations, and 2) aggregate traffic pattern data to predict current traffic so as to determine fastest routes that increase overall fuel efficiency. This will require all vehicles to submit data rapidly to a central cloud, therefore a 5G network or above is necessary to support this kind of fast data transmissions in real time. Road tests from private corporations in China and the US are already underway.

Another emerging machine learning application is the use of quantum computers to significantly increase the speed of the algorithm’s processing and response time. Quantum computers are still being developed but they are predicted to be many times faster than classical computers in certain problems, and by using new quantum techniques that rely on quantum properties, training speed and accuracy of a machine learning algorithm can be greatly improved.



The enormous impact of machine learning is already felt in many workplaces and homes, and it will continue to be the case in the years to come. The world is being empowered by faster decision making based on real data to solve hard problems, using the ever improving CPU speeds and sensor technologies. The increasing coverage of data collection means that more problems can be solved without human intervention. Machines have been trained to solve problems such as deciding if someone is likely to have a disease or deciding what is the best route to take to a destination. The need of human workers in some workplaces will be replaced by the decision making abilities from machine learning algorithms.

In work situations where many workers are needed to assess information to form good business decisions, machine learning will greatly reduce the number of human workers needed as decision makers. Human workers will be placed higher in the work hierarchy to deal with more complicated problems, or simply random check on the decisions made by algorithms. The faster and lower cost decision making means that the bank or financial companies can reduce the overall cost in providing services, and shorten the response time by using credit scoring models, which will in turn increase profit margins. 

The use of a machine learning model has a higher cost to businesses initially, but the long term running cost is much lower than sustaining an employee. The people who have a low educational skill set, and perform streamlined repetitive tasks are going to be redundant first, businesses will create more positions for workers who can deal with more complicated situations, and jobs requiring more creativity or human touch to the solutions.

Positions for engineers, data scientists and machine learning specialists will be in much higher demand in the foreseeable future. They are the major pillars to create, maintain and improve the machine learning systems in many applications in different industries. Bank tellers, loan officers, insurance claim assessors will be redundant because their job will be mostly replaced by the algorithms. This is already happening in Europe, where many rural bank branches are closed to save costs, customers are streamed into online services where they are being served by machine tellers (aka chat bots).



Predicting how society may be transformed by Machine Learning will help me to plan and make better purchasing decisions. Using an e-commerce website with a machine learning recommender, I will be able to find the items to purchase in a more tailored and efficient manner. I feel more satisfied with my shopping experience when the algorithm can understand my preferences from studying purchase history and personal profile. This will greatly reduce the need for daily shopping trips in physical malls, when the shops are better and cheaper online.

The daily driving experience will also be greatly enhanced. Using a traffic app powered by a machine learning algorithm, I am provided with highly accurate traffic data and estimation, which helps me arrive at work on time. When fully self-driving vehicles become a reality, the driver doesn’t need to worry about handling traffic and deal with the stress at all.  I will be able to arrive at work, refreshed, not tired. 

The rise of machine learning algorithms will transform domestic life too. My parents will be able to get automatic shopping delivered regularly  without the need to visit the supermarket every few days. With the IoT (Internet of Things) enabled by advanced sensor technologies, many home appliances will be installed with sensors (such as smart fridges) to collect data necessary for machine learning. The algorithm will work out when the stock level in the fridge is low and make a purchasing order online automatically. They can focus more on enjoying life at home rather than chores of shopping. 

Using machine learning, home assistant robots could in the future, automatically clean the floor, by detecting how dirty the floor, give emotional support

               Overview<br>
               The RPG will have a focus on sentence mining, learning vocabulary and grammar in the context of full sentences rather than single word vocabulary.
               Starting out, battles with enemy characters can be overcome with simple translation. The enemy will say something in either English or the target language, and it’ll be the player’s job to select the correct response via multiple choice answers. If correct, the user will receive a reward in the form of in game currency, an item, or even the enemy becoming playable. If the user selects the wrong answer, a battle will begin.
               Eventually, it will switch from translation to selecting the matching sentence in the target language. For example, instead of translating the sentence ‘where is Tom?’ the correct response will be to select ‘Tom is at home’.
               Tatoeba, a sentence and translation database under various Creative Commons licenses, will be used to build the base API. <br><br>
               
               Motivation<br>
               Nowadays, technology has improved dramatically and the global has become a village. Since people can travel faster around the world, they are interested in learning a new language to communicate with local people in travel destinations. 
               Even though we do not travel to different countries, we contact our relatives, family members, and business partners/colleagues via video calls from various mobile or desktop applications through the internet. Therefore, learning a new language, especially English, plays a role in our work and social life.
               Our project, the Role-Playing Game (RPG) will be used as an educational game instead of traditional teaching methods to improve linguistic skills. Learners should not be dull and lack enthusiasm while studying. The idea of creating the game is that game will motivate students to spend their time more in their studies. The more participation time in playing this game, the more linguistic skill they improve. 
               The use of the game in education will help the learners to enhance interest, concentration, desire to overcome obstacles, and willingness to retry from several failed attempts in their study. Learners will find it easy to memorise vocabulary and grammar in this method of learning and eventually they will achieve their target goals in their paths of learning with fun by playing this game.
               <br><br>
               Description<br>
               The players have to choose their native language and target language they would like to learn at the beginning of the game. A road map will be displayed after selecting the desired languages. In the road map, the players will see a House landmark which is for beginner level of language and there are 50 sub-levels in each landmark location.  Other locations will be only able to see after the players have completed all these first 50 levels, another landmark, a Forest, will be unlocked then next will be a Beach. 
               The reason for having a roadmap is to motivate the players to achieve more levels, for example, some players have curiosity about what landmark would be unlocked after they have finished their current one, some are proud to say when they meet with someone who played the same game and etc.
               Since the game is designed for creating a happy and fun learning environment, we do not want that the players feel stressed and frustrated due to the complexity and difficulty by playing this game. Thus, the first level would be an introduction of a few vocabularies and the second and third stages would be to learn how the vocabularies in the first level are used in sentences and the same pattern would be repeated up to 39 levels. Then, the last 11 levels would be like a test for what they learned from the previous 39 levels and would be harder for players. 
               The player will be a hero and the monsters will be used as enemies. Every next level of the game will introduce the player to stronger enemies and different appearances of monsters. There will be 10 questions for each level and the player will have 3 lives to achieve each level. The player can attempt 2 times for each question and will lose one life if both attempts of the answer are incorrect. If all the lives are lost in each level, the player will have to repeat the level again, i.e., 70% of correction in each level will let the player pass the level.
               When the player enters a fight, a dialogue will be popped up on the head of hero and monster. The language on the monster would be your native language and that on the hero would be the language the players want to learn. It will be a multiple-choice question and the player has to select the correct translation, for example, the dialogue on the monster’s head will display “How are you” in Spanish and the options will be as below on the hero’s head in the target language.
               -	“How are you?”
               -	“Where are you?”
               -	“How is you?”
               -	“What is you?”
               The first 39 levels of each landmark would be a simple translation and a response type would be kicked in last 11 levels with the same rule and multiple-choice options. For example, the monster will ask “How are you” in the target language. 
               -	“ I am fine. Thanks”
               -	“ I am at school.”
               -	“ I am driving.”
               -	“ I am having dinner.”
               The appearance of the monster will be changed according to dialogue which will help better match with game themes and better memorising with images for learners. For example, monsters-based animals will be represented as enemies while learning words related to animals. Free open sources will be used for the availability of the languages and the game will keep a counter to avoid repetitive sentences and words in different levels when we add new resources.
               The game will be saved to the level that the player is playing all the time in case of unexpected exiting from the game due to technical glitches or power interruption. When the player plays the game the next time after he/she exited, the game will be restarted from the level that he/she stopped.  Since this application is an educational game, the players can access earlier levels that have already been completed so that they can review and learn the previous sentences and vocabulary. 
               <br><br>
               
               Tools and technologies,<br>
               First and foremost we will need to create a website, in order to create a website we will utilise HTML,CSS and JavaScript. We will also require a social media presence so accounts will be required on Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok and Twitter. Github will be utilised to ensure the ability to collaborate effectively between developers. Furthermore cloud storage will be a must once the game is fully developed, IBM offers secure commercial solutions. Advertising via google, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, SEO, Blogging influencers, Government initiatives and relative brands.  
               
               Depending on if this project materialises as a 2D or 3D game, there are several free and paid software and assets that may be used. For 3D, the Unity Engine or Unreal Engine are available to use for free
               with no royalties for $100,000 USD annually and the first $1,000,000 USD earned respectively. Unity can also be used for 2D software.
               
               
               
               For 2D, Game Maker Studio 2 has several subscription models available while the multiple versions of RPG Maker only cost an upfront fee for the software with free assets available in all versions and
               even a basic character sprite editor is later iterations.
               
               Vocabulary will be gathered based on the websites and software listed in the overview.<br><br>
               
               Skills<br>
               We will need to have proficiency in the following areas to make this project come to life; coding, graphic design, UI/UX design, audio design, animation, AI modelling, scripting, production. We will also need a game engine to actually run the game on such as Unreal Engine. We need to also ensure that the game would be optimized for a broad range of machines with different specifications. There would also need to be a network administrator maintaining the servers that we would need to use to push OTA updates periodically with new features and bug fixes. The feasibility of these requirements is definitely in our favor considering the time. The hardware availability is quite broad so finding a host server or running our own would not cause many hurdles. Most software’s such as engines are also open source which also broadens our choice. In terms of the skills required, there are plenty of online platforms on which to learn the skills required to make this project a reality, such as skill share or Lynda.com. 
               <br><br>
               
               Outcome<br>
               While no language learning application or software can ever truly teach someone the full extent of a language from zero to fluency, our product will hopefully serve as a valuable resource to help supplement and motivate the language learning experience.
               Better yet, with the current stagnation and oversaturation of extremely simplistic gamified language learning experiences, we hope that our product will pave the way into more innovation and experimentation when it comes to methods of teaching a language.
               It will also, hopefully, help to relax the language learning and polyglot community’s rather strict views on what is and isn’t learning. Inefficient yet popular, stale language learning is the norm among the elite, despite the contradictory science.  Acquisition of a language is quicker and more efficient through exposure in media, having tailored made experiences that are also enjoyable are a much needed and underutilised market.
               Helping to set the standard by creating an accessible, easy to understand, and effective product is the true long-term goal.
               Language learning should be for everyone, global communication should not be gatekept or watered down to such a degree that it’s ineffective. That is the outcome we at NetIT wish to make a reality.
