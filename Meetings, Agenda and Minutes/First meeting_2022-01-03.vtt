<v Nathaniel Giucci>The session so that we've got something to give to the lecturers.</v>

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:09.730
<v Enoch Liu>Good.</v>

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:18.360
<v Nathaniel Giucci>OK, so that's recording now. We can now start the meeting and I'll let you take the floor on what you got up to over the last few days, but the assignment.</v>

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.210
<v Enoch Liu>Not much.</v>

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.440
<v Nathaniel Giucci>But like.</v>

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.230
<v Enoch Liu>They will see 1/2.</v>

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.210
<v Enoch Liu>Did look at the.</v>

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.160
<v Enoch Liu>Personal profile, but not much else.</v>

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.970
<v Enoch Liu>I'm more focused.</v>

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.510
<v Enoch Liu>Sing getting work done frankly.</v>

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:37.890
<v Enoch Liu>This.</v>

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.030
<v Enoch Liu>This this the newest loses.</v>

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.960
<v Enoch Liu>Do you do you?</v>

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:51.010
<v Enoch Liu>But I think things are going well, however, and I think I can see see why we need to focus on next.</v>

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:55.350
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Yeah.</v>

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:11.260
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Like I understand where you're coming from, I've made a good start on the personal information or sorry the background information and also started the team profile if I can share my screen.</v>

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:20.090
<v Enoch Liu>But I'll be dedicate I I have done that much 'cause let's see. I'm not sure who who was responsible for starting up the profile.</v>

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.470
<v Nathaniel Giucci>I've made a start.</v>

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.960
<v Nathaniel Giucci>I can't work out how to share my screen.</v>

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.230
<v Enoch Liu>I mean admin will stop it.</v>

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.980
<v Nathaniel Giucci>I think it's.</v>

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.330
<v Nathaniel Giucci>This one here.</v>

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.310
<v Nathaniel Giucci>He said not.</v>

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.110
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Uh, can you see my screen?</v>

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.810
<v Enoch Liu>Yep.</v>

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.070
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Just they have done something, just bear with me one moment.</v>

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.910
<v Enoch Liu>Thank you for doing the right thing for that.</v>

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.530
<v Nathaniel Giucci>I've got you.</v>

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.590
<v Nathaniel Giucci>That's alright.</v>

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:06.380
<v Enoch Liu>At least I I sent you the website so we could. We could collaborate together. If you don't good move.</v>

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.020
<v Nathaniel Giucci>OK.</v>

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.600
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Yeah, so I've.</v>

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.050
<v Enoch Liu>So what do you want me to?</v>

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:28.010
<v Nathaniel Giucci>I'm not 100% sure. OK, so I've done my background information. It's a little bit more than a paragraph, but it's broke. It's a paragraph, but it's broken up into two sections. As you can see, one of the hobbies background.</v>

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.730
<v Enoch Liu>I I might put my back on information as well.</v>

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.170
<v Enoch Liu>Eventually.</v>

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.310
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Yeah, so I've done that. I've.</v>

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:36.830
<v Enoch Liu>Also my Papa.</v>

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.750
<v Nathaniel Giucci>I'm sorry.</v>

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.980
<v Enoch Liu>Awesome, my actual off my back come information as well. I might be able to do that as well. It's time.</v>

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.980
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Well, I've started writing yours out.</v>

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.660
<v Enoch Liu>Anyway.</v>

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.650
<v Nathaniel Giucci>So that because I'm I'm better with the the writing rather than the technical side of it.</v>

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.720
<v Enoch Liu>That's good.</v>

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:02.830
<v Nathaniel Giucci>So I've.</v>

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:13.020
<v Nathaniel Giucci>I'm better with the communication, so I've started writing out the your test results. What use score? I've gotta make it start after I finish this section off?</v>

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.670
<v Nathaniel Giucci>I'm going to put my information in there and then do one analysis of all of it.</v>

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.430
<v Enoch Liu>Yep.</v>

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.470
<v Nathaniel Giucci>On what's going on and how that's.</v>

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.020
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Going to work as a team and all that.</v>

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.890
<v Nathaniel Giucci>OK, ah, let me just work out how to.</v>

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.970
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Stop sharing my screen.</v>

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.320
<v Nathaniel Giucci>To that button there Yep.</v>

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.490
<v Nathaniel Giucci>OK, so that's.</v>

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.050
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Where I'm up to so.</v>

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.440
<v Nathaniel Giucci>If you can condense your background information and your interest in.</v>

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.150
<v Nathaniel Giucci>IT, and where else was it was something else.</v>

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.040
<v Enoch Liu>Well, I'm not.</v>

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.020
<v Enoch Liu>I think we can condense my personal my background and IT.</v>

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.770
<v Enoch Liu>Because information back on the T zone.</v>

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:06.780
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Yeah so.</v>

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.760
<v Enoch Liu>But anything I would need some help with that because I'm not the best writing writing.</v>

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.010
<v Nathaniel Giucci>OK, I can have a look at that as well.</v>

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.880
<v Nathaniel Giucci>OK.</v>

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.090
<v Nathaniel Giucci>And I can try and condense that down into.</v>

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:24.060
<v Enoch Liu>I'll I'll I'll, I'll assist you. I will text you as well.</v>

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:33.420
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Yeah I, I'll have a go at it. I'll send you a link to it and you can adjust it as you see fit.</v>

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:45.380
<v Nathaniel Giucci>But it's just going to be basically your name, your student number, your background, hobbies, interests and experience, and we will need to add in a team name.</v>

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.880
<v Enoch Liu>You know my student. If he did, you do know my student number, of course, because that's in the.</v>

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.710
<v Enoch Liu>This is it in the.</v>

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.030
<v Nathaniel Giucci>In the profile. Yeah, I've got your profile up here so I can see all that.</v>

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.970
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Uhm no no no.</v>

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.370
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Bear with me so I can write that for you.</v>

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.830
<v Nathaniel Giucci>I've.</v>

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.200
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Organized.</v>

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.360
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Uh, where is it?</v>

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:12.670
<v Nathaniel Giucci>I've lost it hold up.</v>

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.770
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Ah.</v>

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:23.560
<v Nathaniel Giucci>It was.</v>

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.280
<v Nathaniel Giucci>We'll have to do the ideal jobs.</v>

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:29.330
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Bye.</v>

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.650
<v Nathaniel Giucci>I I'm best if I work with deadlines.</v>

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.680
<v Nathaniel Giucci>So what's the date today?</v>

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.920
<v Enoch Liu>I think we do do it by the body 5th.</v>

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:40.330
<v Enoch Liu>I get.</v>

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.790
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Yeah.</v>

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:46.640
<v Enoch Liu>You can't do, but then we have to postpone it get. I think we should get done.</v>

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:49.800
<v Enoch Liu>I would also like to.</v>

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.230
<v Enoch Liu>Have both because I forgot what role Rose I had it.</v>

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:07.430
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Yeah so.</v>

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.200
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Are you able to visualize?</v>

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:22.460
<v Nathaniel Giucci>So the ideal jobs mines working in cyber security and ethical hacking.</v>

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:30.360
<v Nathaniel Giucci>And from yours, where is it? Just bring it up. Ideal job.</v>

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:28.390
<v Enoch Liu>See.</v>

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:31.600
<v Enoch Liu>It in cybersecurity.</v>

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:37.640
<v Enoch Liu>He almost had to protect against it, but also data analysis, which is why.</v>

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:38.740
<v Enoch Liu>In</v>

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:40.510
<v Enoch Liu>in do.</v>

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.450
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Yeah, so yours is developers and programming.</v>

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.830
<v Nathaniel Giucci>From your profile. So if we can, and I've lost it.</v>

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:59.590
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Just got out of it. That's alright, I'll get back into that eventually. UM, if we can make a list of comparison of.</v>

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:02.380
<v Nathaniel Giucci>What age jobs going to?</v>

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.990
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Compare contrast in the ideas of each person.</v>

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:13.520
<v Nathaniel Giucci>In the group I have changed due to feedback from assignment. One welcome to elements are there if any what?</v>

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:19.910
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Differentiate each position from the others. If anything, how similar or different.</v>

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.740
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Are your career plans across the group?</v>

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:39.320
<v Nathaniel Giucci>It can be tackled universe ways and writing and visual elements or concise coverage, analysis, conclusion covering all would be good. Johnny recommended table presentation of comparison data as it is very easy to highlight a lot of information, simple for others to read and interpret.</v>

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:37.910
<v Enoch Liu>I think, uh.</v>

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:47.020
<v Enoch Liu>Yes, I I figured be good too. Did you contrast on one table? Contrasts on the table?</v>

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.650
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Yeah, so if.</v>

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:49.320
<v Enoch Liu>Yep.</v>

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:50.790
<v Nathaniel Giucci>We</v>

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:54.380
<v Nathaniel Giucci>write up a table.</v>

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:57.620
<v Nathaniel Giucci>That has.</v>

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:04.950
<v Nathaniel Giucci>I'm just brainstorming here. I'm not 100% sure here, but we have a table will have.</v>

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:07.610
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Cyber security role.</v>

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:13.900
<v Nathaniel Giucci>And then which? And ethical hacking, which is what I want to get into and your role.</v>

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:11.710
<v Enoch Liu>Yep.</v>

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:17.040
<v Enoch Liu>Why is it that guilty? But mostly their size now?</v>

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:20.070
<v Nathaniel Giucci>The programming and we list and released all the skills that we need against each other.</v>

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:25.470
<v Nathaniel Giucci>It's like so first skill experience with Wireshark.</v>

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:25.110
<v Enoch Liu>Yes.</v>

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.510
<v Nathaniel Giucci>For cyber security.</v>

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:26.930
<v Enoch Liu>Because.</v>

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.950
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Programming Python.</v>

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:39.680
<v Enoch Liu>SQ database analysis, then waste management for their science. That's all. Is that the understanding?</v>

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:35.630
<v Nathaniel Giucci>It's.</v>

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:39.420
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Yeah.</v>

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:44.050
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Yeah, so if you can go through and do that.</v>

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.330
<v Nathaniel Giucci>That will have them be able to visualize that.</v>

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:53.230
<v Nathaniel Giucci>We will be able to have a good idea of.</v>

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:56.850
<v Nathaniel Giucci>How we compare the jobs and the contrast and?</v>

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.950
<v Nathaniel Giucci>What's different about each row and what's similar?</v>

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:03.820
<v Nathaniel Giucci>And.</v>

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:08.620
<v Nathaniel Giucci>How we and then we'll meet up again after that's done, and we will.</v>

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:12.130
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Uhm?</v>

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:18.180
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Discuss how different our career paths across the group are gonna be, how best to get into those areas.</v>

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.150
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Does that work for you?</v>

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.360
<v Enoch Liu>That works I think.</v>

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:32.500
<v Enoch Liu>But he doesn't think quite hear that.</v>

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:35.750
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Uh.</v>

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.210
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Which part didn't you hear?</v>

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:41.690
<v Enoch Liu>If you can't, that's fine, but I needed.</v>

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:55.360
<v Nathaniel Giucci>So once we have the table listed, we'll be able to go through and compare.</v>

00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:01.220
<v Nathaniel Giucci>What happened, what each role entails, and with the differences and similarities.</v>

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:03.820
<v Enoch Liu>Did different groups.</v>

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:03.690
<v Nathaniel Giucci>And.</v>

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:09.710
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Yeah, just across the users of like in this group the.</v>

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:15.450
<v Nathaniel Giucci>People that are in the group will need to compare the different jobs and how to get into those.</v>

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.440
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Once that tables written weekend, then discuss how.</v>

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.860
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Different in how we're going to get the.</v>

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:28.890
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Across the career path.</v>

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.470
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Yeah, does that make sense?</v>

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:34.560
<v Enoch Liu>That makes sense I.</v>

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:44.270
<v Enoch Liu>I just swing between people skills and sets. Is that OK? People showing.</v>

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:43.180
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Yeah.</v>

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:49.040
<v Enoch Liu>And name of people on others? Is that the idea?</v>

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:52.630
<v Nathaniel Giucci>So I was just going to say.</v>

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:56.010
<v Nathaniel Giucci>In a table we right.</v>

00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:59.720
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Like I want to get into cyber security.</v>

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:03.040
<v Nathaniel Giucci>So we put that as a heading of one of the tables.</v>

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:09.040
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Similar, let's see if I can bring something else up so it'll have like.</v>

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:06.640
<v Enoch Liu>Yeah.</v>

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:14.250
<v Nathaniel Giucci>I'll just quickly mock something up like now if I can get down to work.</v>

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:16.790
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Uh.</v>

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:18.660
<v Nathaniel Giucci>I will.</v>

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:21.590
<v Nathaniel Giucci>You blank document.</v>

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:24.720
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Insert.</v>

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:26.720
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Able.</v>

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.540
<v Nathaniel Giucci>And over here we have.</v>

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:46.360
<v Nathaniel Giucci>I'm programming wasn't.</v>

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:51.300
<v Nathaniel Giucci>That was your ideal job programming.</v>

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:51.820
<v Enoch Liu>Well, what?</v>

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:58.200
<v Enoch Liu>Our programming, well, I can tell it is.</v>

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:02.590
<v Enoch Liu>The interest is basically it, it says.</v>

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:11.080
<v Enoch Liu>Look at the interesting that tipping. I'm more programming but also not computing other Fishel intelligence and data analysis.</v>

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.570
<v Nathaniel Giucci>And programming.</v>

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:16.080
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Data.</v>

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:18.500
<v Enoch Liu>So.</v>

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:22.410
<v Nathaniel Giucci>This so I'm just going to quickly share my screen.</v>

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:28.120
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Go to this one.</v>

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:34.170
<v Nathaniel Giucci>So can you see my screen down here how I've got the heading cyber security?</v>

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:37.640
<v Nathaniel Giucci>And then.</v>

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:38.330
<v Enoch Liu>Yes.</v>

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:41.910
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Programming and data analysis. And then maybe they stay on all the different.</v>

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:54.720
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Skills that you need to get into cyber security and all the different needs skills we need to get into programming and data analysis down a list so that then we can visualize that a bit better as they OK, there's some crossover here.</v>

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:01.010
<v Nathaniel Giucci>And what's different? What's the same and how that can be?</v>

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:07.800
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Used for the ideal job portion of the assignment.</v>

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:18.120
<v Enoch Liu>Yes, basically come.</v>

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.560
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Yes, Sir.</v>

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:19.990
<v Enoch Liu>I see.</v>

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:23.950
<v Enoch Liu>So basically</v>

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:26.060
<v Enoch Liu>the.</v>

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:29.120
<v Enoch Liu>This field we want to get into and skills.</v>

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:30.170
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Yep.</v>

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:33.370
<v Enoch Liu>And and skills or tools that we need. It's OK.</v>

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:34.350
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Yes.</v>

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:36.610
<v Nathaniel Giucci>That's exactly it.</v>

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.070
<v Nathaniel Giucci>That is exactly it.</v>

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:44.630
<v Enoch Liu>Yep.</v>

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:51.820
<v Enoch Liu>By the way, we're looking at the transcript that is being generated.</v>

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:49.550
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Yeah.</v>

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:54.700
<v Enoch Liu>Pretty funny, you know.</v>

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:53.300
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Yeah.</v>

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:56.330
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Yeah.</v>

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:03.910
<v Nathaniel Giucci>OK, I have organized this is what I'm doing tomorrow.</v>

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.370
<v Nathaniel Giucci>I'm going to interview.</v>

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:09.400
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Some IT professionals.</v>

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:13.730
<v Enoch Liu>I'm going to ask my.</v>

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:22.890
<v Enoch Liu>We'll ask people around us, so if they want to be interviewed, but you can you, I might be interesting that it's sort of my head.</v>

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:27.750
<v Nathaniel Giucci>So I was going to interview two people.</v>

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:32.550
<v Nathaniel Giucci>I've got two interviews lined up tomorrow.</v>

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:37.800
<v Nathaniel Giucci>So I'm going to discuss with them the questions that we're in.</v>

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:39.450
<v Enoch Liu>I don't have any any to be lined up so.</v>

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:41.680
<v Enoch Liu>That's it.</v>

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:44.780
<v Enoch Liu>Thank you for doing that, I'll do.</v>

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:46.970
<v Enoch Liu>Our technical work.</v>

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:48.930
<v Enoch Liu>In the meanwhile.</v>

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:50.370
<v Enoch Liu>Uh.</v>

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:56.340
<v Enoch Liu>Did my on description and pinned up one of two or more of the new modules.</v>

00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:57.990
<v Nathaniel Giucci>OK.</v>

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:17.460
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Yes, so on Wednesday, at roughly the same time we'll meet up again. I'll play the recording for the interviews that we've had that I've had with IT professionals. I've got two, and if you can.</v>

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:20.480
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Have the list of.</v>

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:27.260
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Job skills for data analysis and programming versus cyber security.</v>

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:32.980
<v Nathaniel Giucci>And we will make back.</v>

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:34.950
<v Nathaniel Giucci>On Wednesday, at the same time.</v>

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:41.590
<v Enoch Liu>Yes.</v>

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:48.390
<v Enoch Liu>Meanwhile, I want that that be great. In new I wanted.</v>

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:53.720
<v Enoch Liu>Since since it ever did did we don't have Members now group.</v>

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.200
<v Enoch Liu>The per member hasn't responded yet. Have have you tempted?</v>

00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:02.660
<v Nathaniel Giucci>I have checked they haven't responded. I've sent out some.</v>

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:00.380
<v Enoch Liu>I got that.</v>

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:09.450
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Talks I've sent out some messages via teams to some other teams and see if they were looking.</v>

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:14.990
<v Nathaniel Giucci>At joining or merging into one group, I haven't heard anything back yet.</v>

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.970
<v Nathaniel Giucci>So I might send them another message.</v>

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:19.190
<v Enoch Liu>Well, but once that.</v>

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:22.710
<v Enoch Liu>Yes I will.</v>

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:24.820
<v Enoch Liu>One day I.</v>

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:30.410
<v Enoch Liu>We have a new team. We have something to merge with all these enough Members that we don't have to.</v>

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:33.390
<v Enoch Liu>SP the two of us together.</v>

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:33.560
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Yeah.</v>

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:46.760
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Yeah, I totally agree like doing it with just two people is a bit hard, but at least we've got some progress made. If we do join another group like here's what we've done.</v>

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:55.290
<v Nathaniel Giucci>He's our shared. There's what we've done in our own group. We have now merged together. Just transfer all the information across to them so that they have.</v>

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:58.090
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Everything relevant before.</v>

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:01.390
<v Nathaniel Giucci>The assignment.</v>

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:04.970
<v Nathaniel Giucci>So that have our team profile.</v>

00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:17.560
<v Nathaniel Giucci>So our names, our personal information, the outcome of our tests already written ready to go and then the ideal job comparison that's all ready to go so it just adds into theirs.</v>

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:25.600
<v Nathaniel Giucci>So I'll keep sending out some feelers and seeing if anybody wants to merge into the one group.</v>

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:31.720
<v Enoch Liu>It's not.</v>

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:42.820
<v Enoch Liu>Understand I'll try to do my best present. I've got some. I've got a lot of things I'm going to have to start up soon.</v>

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:44.470
<v Enoch Liu>I might</v>

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.910
<v Enoch Liu>postpone my also I think.</v>

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:59.150
<v Enoch Liu>This this type of meat is interesting. Is this the only time we can do meetings or do we want?</v>

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:01.980
<v Enoch Liu>This is the school holidays basically and we.</v>

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:01.430
<v Nathaniel Giucci>I'll just giving us.</v>

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:06.900
<v Enoch Liu>Just give me a time.</v>

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:10.220
<v Enoch Liu>I just I've been confused can.</v>

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:12.970
<v Enoch Liu>Like</v>

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:22.210
<v Enoch Liu>opium is a fine time for meetings, but do you want to do? You want to make it a little earlier or little data? Which one?</v>

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:24.690
<v Nathaniel Giucci>I'm easy.</v>

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.980
<v Enoch Liu>Do you have an active time?</v>

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:27.180
<v Nathaniel Giucci>I'm easy with whatever time.</v>

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:34.240
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Come on Thursdays and Fridays. I don't finish work until 6:00 o'clock.</v>

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:31.750
<v Enoch Liu>I'm with his home then.</v>

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:38.280
<v Nathaniel Giucci>So I would have to be after six on Thursday or Fridays.</v>

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:45.440
<v Nathaniel Giucci>But I'm happy to meet whenever you said.</v>

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:46.320
<v Enoch Liu>I think six 6:30 for those meetings if.</v>

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:53.800
<v Nathaniel Giucci>I'm sorry, please continue.</v>

00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:57.010
<v Enoch Liu>Was it good?</v>

00:18:59.100 --> 00:18:59.590
<v Enoch Liu>Can hear you.</v>

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:06.110
<v Enoch Liu>You could just we could do if we do have those meetings, I might do 6:30.</v>

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.790
<v Enoch Liu>Turn off time or do you want 7?</v>

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:10.480
<v Nathaniel Giucci>At 6:30 is fine.</v>

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:15.820
<v Enoch Liu>Yeah it is.</v>

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:20.740
<v Enoch Liu>So this money for 15 fighting meetings and we can do.</v>

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:18.860
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Do you?</v>

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:24.030
<v Enoch Liu>You only things that needed.</v>

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:30.710
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Yeah I I think 4:34 o'clock works fine for the meetings as.</v>

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:36.260
<v Nathaniel Giucci>That's what time we originally agreed on, but just on those days where I worked until.</v>

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:38.590
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Six, I think.</v>

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:41.660
<v Nathaniel Giucci>6:30 is a perfect time.</v>

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:44.910
<v Enoch Liu>Yes.</v>

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.150
<v Enoch Liu>Those were good times.</v>

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:50.790
<v Enoch Liu>I do have.</v>

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:54.800
<v Enoch Liu>What?</v>

00:19:56.670 --> 00:20:04.260
<v Enoch Liu>I must I am. I have things unfold, clocks soon enough, but maybe not until the end of natural when when when I finish up.</v>

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:12.970
<v Enoch Liu>If this if something comes up that I have to abandon full hall, we might move back at three o'clock. Let them.</v>

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:14.050
<v Enoch Liu>They.</v>

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:16.970
<v Enoch Liu>You know?</v>

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:24.600
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Yeah, that can work. Do you just wanna make from six o'clock 6:30 from now on?</v>

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:20.590
<v Enoch Liu>I am.</v>

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:29.680
<v Enoch Liu>I've yeah, yeah.</v>

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:28.810
<v Nathaniel Giucci>And.</v>

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:36.250
<v Enoch Liu>No, because lots of easy slot that I have in the past filled up with something else.</v>

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:42.010
<v Nathaniel Giucci>OK, So what time would be a better time for you when you have plans?</v>

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:48.790
<v Enoch Liu>At any time after six will be fine as well. I don't think we're both we're both boys of the 6:30.</v>

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:50.350
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Yeah.</v>

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:57.890
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Alright, so when we meet up on Wednesday, we'll meet up at 6:30. That'll give me a chance to finalize the.</v>

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:00.150
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Interview that we need to do.</v>

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.030
<v Nathaniel Giucci>So I can do it, I'll do that.</v>

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:10.820
<v Nathaniel Giucci>And get that all sorted by 6:00 o'clock on Wednesday.</v>

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:12.680
<v Enoch Liu>I know how do what you asked me to, which is.</v>

00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:18.000
<v Enoch Liu>Which is listing the top skills. I may be helping sample website.</v>

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:20.860
<v Enoch Liu>Do you want me to have self the website for you?</v>

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:19.390
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Yeah.</v>

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:23.680
<v Enoch Liu>I can I can do that on my account if you need to.</v>

00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:22.680
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Yes.</v>

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:27.040
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Yes, we'll need to set up with the website. If you.</v>

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:27.370
<v Enoch Liu>Or we can do it.</v>

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:35.250
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Because you're better with the technical side of things, I think you set up the website and once I've relay all the information to you.</v>

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:38.300
<v Nathaniel Giucci>You put that onto the website and.</v>

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:41.800
<v Nathaniel Giucci>You've got to add both of the profiles to it.</v>

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:42.400
<v Enoch Liu>Yes, we really.</v>

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:43.830
<v Enoch Liu>Thank you.</v>

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:50.990
<v Enoch Liu>You know we should be via text document because I it's much easier if we do it that way also.</v>

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:51.330
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Yeah.</v>

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:58.690
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Yeah, so once we've got once I've got bits and pieces down, I'll send them to you and you can start putting it onto the website.</v>

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:04.580
<v Nathaniel Giucci>But before we can do the website, we need to think of a team name.</v>

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:07.210
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Have you thought of anything?</v>

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:10.320
<v Enoch Liu>The beat.</v>

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:17.810

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:14.680
<v Nathaniel Giucci>Because I haven't had it.</v>

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:25.140
