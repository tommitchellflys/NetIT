<h1>Interview with Data engineer Christine</h1>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> <span style="color:#808080">[00:00:00]</span> Uh, just to confirm that you are okay with recording this interview for my, RMIT assignment. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Christine:</strong> Absolutely. Yes. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> Awesome. Thank you very much. I'm here with Christine. We're going to talk about her IT professional, what she does. So the </p>
<p>first question I have, please tell </p>
<p>us about your IT work, what exactly is it that you do?</p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Christine:</strong> Okay. I do do a lot of things. Um, mainly I work with very large data sets. Um, doing a lot of analysis and data mining and reporting and things like that. So I need too manipulate the data to fit into the way that we need it to be able to report on it and analyze </p>
<p>it. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> Not knowing much about IT. Can you please elaborate a little bit more if possible.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Christine:</strong> Okay. </p>
<p>So. Um, </p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> you were talking about visualizing the data set or manipulating the data sets. What exactly does that mean? </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Christine:</strong> So we <span style="color:#808080">[00:01:00]</span> extract data from a lot of different systems, um, and the different systems have different formats and different ways of recording data. So in order to merge data sets or create massive data sets, we need to manipulate the data.</p>
<p>So the. format is consistent with the data store that we use, I suppose. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> Okay. </p>
<p>Okay. Next question is, um, please tell us about the industry that you work in </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Christine:</strong> the government, </p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> and I'm assuming, because you do what for the government, you can't of elaborate on what department you actually work in or what your actual role is </p>
<p>within that department </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Christine:</strong> thats right so my answeres, are probably going to be a little bit generic, but I'll try and make.</p>
<p>As detailed as I can without compromising the work that we do. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> ok, thank you very much for that. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Christine:</strong> That's okay. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> What are the kinds of work you have to do? in your IT profession</p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Christine:</strong> So I have to manage <span style="color:#808080">[00:02:00]</span> people, which sucks but we also create apps and dashboards for our clients, I suppose, to, to make it as self-sufficient as possible.</p>
<p>So they can self serve rather than request the same data over and over again, they have the ability to use these apps. or these dashboards to find the information that they need. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> Okay. do you actually design the app your self or is it adifferent </p>
<p>team. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Christine:</strong> It, the other people within the branch do design the apps. I do provide a lot of input into the apps and what we need from the apps.</p>
<p>As well as, I'm in the data development and engineering team, that's what they call us. So I, I have to work with them and they have to work with me. So I know how to prepare the data for input into these apps, </p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> ok. </p>
<p>Thank you very much for answering that question. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Christine:</strong> You're welcome. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> who <span style="color:#808080">[00:03:00]</span> are all the different people you interact with at work, please.</p>
<p>tell us about them? </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Christine:</strong> Okay. So I think I interacted with quite a few people, but a lot of technical people, as well as a lot of I suppose, as you would call them political people cause senior executive and things like that, more interested in what, you know, the government needs, where where as the technical people were doing what the.</p>
<p>SES needs us to do, a lot of data scientists, a lot of data and engineers, and then a lot of senior executive and ministers and secretaries and things like that. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> Do you have </p>
<p>much dealings with the general populace within your position like external stakeholders that actually use the </p>
<p>apps and, </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Christine:</strong> oh, they wouldn't use the apps, so the dashboards, but we do provide them some external.</p>
<p>agencys and departments with data so it kind of line level data. <span style="color:#808080">[00:04:00]</span> If we've got an MOU, a memorandum of understanding with them. Um, but in terms of the general public, I might respond to freedom of information requests. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> Okay. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Christine:</strong> But only if it's appropriate and classified correctly. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> So the freedoms of information is.</p>
<p>the General populus trying to get their information or what they have mentioned being used for out of the government agency you work for, </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Christine:</strong> pretty much. So they were asking questions about certain things within, your, that might relate to our department and we'll give them as much information as we can under the freedom of information act.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> Okay. Fascinating. This really does sound like a fascinating job that you do. please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals you touched briefly before on data analysts, data engineers. What exactly did you, if you can, if you know, how your work and their <span style="color:#808080">[00:05:00]</span> work, correlate with each other to provide the services you need to provide in your government department?</p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Christine:</strong> Yeah. So as I said, I prepare the data. Um, a lot of times we've got a cleanse data, as well as manipulate it.</p>
<p>We work with a bunch of humans, who input data and there's always a level of human error. Um, but other IT professionals that I worked for because we extract data from legacy systems and things like that. Sometimes I do have to work with the people, the business owners, all of those systems. Um, so you know, sometimes myself I'll have to call IT support.</p>
<p>So the thing or another team that manages the systems, that I get the data from just to make sure I'm getting all of the data that I need. And then I'm able to get the data that the SQL that we write works to <span style="color:#808080">[00:06:00]</span> pull out the data. Um, so it's not just data scientists and engineers that I work with it's other IT professors.</p>
<p>that look after system. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> I do actually like the fact that you do use sometimes use the tech support. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Christine:</strong> Yeah of course </p>
<p>I think it's very important, </p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> but I do assume that everybody knows everything in the IT industry. So therefore there are some people that do specialized in different areas of troubleshooting. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Christine:</strong> Yeah. So we've definitely got a lot of different types of IT specialists.</p>
<p>Um, I'm sure that they would be someone, lots of people in our branch who could do what these it support people do. But, you know, it's just, um, polite to ask for them to manage their own systems and, you know, give them something to do, </p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> you mentioned um data cleansing is that we just clean it up and pretty it up for visualization </p>
<p>or </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Christine:</strong> no.</p>
<p>So data cleansing is where you go and verify <span style="color:#808080">[00:07:00]</span> that the information included in your data set. He is correct and should be there. So when I say data cleansing, we're actually checking individual records of whatever it is that that data set relates to, to verify that it should be included in that data set, but it's not a system error or a human error or things like that.</p>
<p>And data cleansing, actually, a lot of my team do that work because it's absolutely necessary. For the analysis and reporting to be as accurate as possible. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> How long have you been in the data industry for </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Christine:</strong> I've been in this particular position since 2000. And in this particular team since 20 0 9, so 12 years.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> Okay. so been in that for a little bit </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Christine:</strong> little bit. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> Um, what about your interactions with clients and visitors i know you, do, investors sorry i you <span style="color:#808080">[00:08:00]</span> know, you've mentioned the SES and political sides of it, are there any other clients or investors you do speak to </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Christine:</strong> yeah. So there are other business areas within my department. There are also other areas external to my department that I talked to him when we worked together.</p>
<p>It depe depends what the request is. It depends what I'm able to do, but we work together to try and find a solution that suits us both. Well, that suits us all really. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> Okay. Thank you. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Christine:</strong> And also actual ministers. So senate estimates and stuff. When parliament is sitting and they're doing Senate estimates, we get a lot of questions on notice.</p>
<p>So they'll ask our secretary or our minister a particular question. who can't, answer it because he doesn't have the information that he needs. So we get that question on notice and we need to provide the government with an answer that satisfies a minister's question, which could be completely inappropriate.</p>
<p>so, it's good fun. <span style="color:#808080">[00:09:00]</span> </p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> Don't get me wrong. It does sound interesting, but it also sounds really hard at the same time. especally those notices of </p>
<p>questions on notice of that sounded very challenging. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Christine:</strong> Yes. Yeah. Good word. That's a great word for it. It can be very challenging at times, especially like the position I'm in. Because I'm in the middle of the, the minions, the technical people, that do the work and then the senior executive who just want their answers, the questions answered regardless of whether it's possible or not.</p>
<p>So, yeah, it's very challenging managing upwards and managing downwards, </p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> which does lead into my next question quite well, What aspect of your work you spend the </p>
<p>most time on</p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Christine:</strong> managing people , people, people, people, so my team, my particular <span style="color:#808080">[00:10:00]</span> team, their focus would probably be data cleansing and, um, maintaining data stores.</p>
<p>Um, but my particular job is really focused on managing people upwards and downwards. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> Yeah. You mentioned data stores. Is that like a wearhouse or servers that do store the data on them? </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Christine:</strong> Yeah, both a bit of both. So with warehouses, we've got servers. We've also just got our own data stores that we use the SAS programs, statstical analysis software to store that data.</p>
<p>And like, when I say data. I mean really large data sets, which are looking out to billions of records. Most of them are in the millions, but yet quite a few billions. So we've got a lot of different platforms where our data sits, depending how large the data sets are </p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> I'd hate to be a data cleanser </p>
<p>going through those billions of, <span style="color:#808080">[00:11:00]</span> because that would be very time consuming from my understanding </p>
<p>of </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Christine:</strong> absolutely.</p>
<p>So one data set that we have is anywhere up to 40,000 records a month. Need to be manually checked. So data clensing is manual, manual verification, and then we've got other data stores, which are like, you know, between 602,000 records, a week that needs checks. So we've got quite a large team doing it. We need to, but it's so important that we do it to make sure that the data is as accurate as possible </p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> you said that you spend most of your time on managing staff, how many staff do you manage</p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Christine:</strong> at the moment </p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> . </p>
<p> Directly below you or in your department </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Christine:</strong> Well, at the moment I've got nine, that report directly to me and some of those people manage staff as well. in our team And, um, so yeah, there's a about. Um, just off the top of my head, let's say I around <span style="color:#808080">[00:12:00]</span> 25 people who kind of eventually up the line report to me. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> Okay. </p>
<p>That'd be very challenging. as well managing all those staff no, </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Christine:</strong> as I said, People</p>
<p>are my biggest challenge, and that's just not managing people like this is for the data cleansing as well. A lot of it is human error. And so again, that's people and I need to try and engage these people to understand. What they're doing wrong and to try and get a little bit of commitment from them to try and make it a little bit easier down the line.</p>
<p>So you don't have to cleanse quite as much. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> Okay. </p>
<p>I know you said managing people challenging, but what aspect of your work do you find less challenge </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Christine:</strong> people managing people. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> Are there any other aspects that you find more challenging? Well, just as</p>
<p>challenging is going to keep people.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Christine:</strong> Yeah. So other challenges we've got other different, <span style="color:#808080">[00:13:00]</span> the different systems.</p>
<p>We get the data from, are not very compatible. Um, and so, and also the way the data is stored after we've got, it is not necessarily the same. So having to understand, and know, several different coding languages is quite setting up the data stores using whatever code we're using at the time is quite challenging.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> what Programming or data language do you use the most?</p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Christine:</strong> SQL. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> Yeah. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Christine:</strong> Um, SAS BASE R we are, we do want to move to Python, but most of our apps are shiny apps which are R code. Um, we do use a little bit of Java and HTML. But yeah, the main ones would be SQL SAS and R maybe a bit <span style="color:#808080">[00:14:00]</span> of Python</p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> and finally for the the questionsfor today can you share examples of work that you do that best captures the essence of,the IT industry I do know that you can't really speak too much about specific examples being in the industry that you work in and for working with the government, but is there without revealing any sensitive information.</p>
<p>Is there any way you could possibly share </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Christine:</strong> um, yeah, so probably creating the apps. So the shiny apps that we use generally extract data from several different systems and puts it all in one nice tidy place where. You know, if we're manually verifying, verifying information, we can use these apps because it has all of the latest events.</p>
<p>So I suppose for that particular data and the dashboards, so we're trying to <span style="color:#808080">[00:15:00]</span> make as much of our data self-service as much as we can. So these Tablo dashboards are really handy because they quite user friendly. And they're very intuitive and no matter what, no matter who's doing no matter, who's asking a question, let's have about three different people that ask the same question.</p>
<p>They can use these dashboards and they will always get the same answers as each other, which is so important for continuity of </p>
<p>reporting. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> Okay. It sounds like it's a streamlining process as well, but if somebody somewhere asks one question and somebody else does. No matter where they are or what they do, my understanding is that they can get the same answer in that self service.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Christine:</strong> That's the plan so that's the idea of it. Um, and we're, we're actually in the early stages of creating this you know self service thing. people are so stuck in their ways and I asked for data in different ways and we're really trying to push them towards <span style="color:#808080">[00:16:00]</span> serving themselves and getting the information.</p>
<p>Themselves, but it is a process and a lot of people are reluctant to do it because as I said, i work for the government, public servants is stuck in their ways. They're very headstrong and just want to do it the way they've always done it because they've resistant to change. These changes will be really, really good.</p>
<p><strong style="color:#d82292">Nathaniel:</strong> Awesome. Awesome. Thank you very much for your time,Christine once again, this conversation is recorded. I do have your permission to use this for my assignment at RMIT.</p>
<p> Yes. Yes. </p>
<p>Thanks very much for your time. </p>
<p><strong style="color:#fa8a3b">Christine:</strong> You're welcome. Thank you.</p>
